            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>At Darkshade Inc., every product we make is built to last. We provide durable, 
                easy-to-use software solutions with innovative features that customers depend on, 
                all while protecting their privacy and data. Customers should have access to safe, 
                reliable, and secure solutions with genuine support if they need them. 
                Technology is transforming work in just about every sector of the global economy—and
                while these advances have created unparalleled opportunities for many, far too few have
                access to the quality education, training and job opportunities required to improve their
                economic and social mobility in a changing landscape. <br><br>

                Darkshade Inc. organization addresses the need to ensure all communities are prepared for the
                jobs driving the future, and to date has awarded approximately $65 million to support more 
                than 70 organizations working to inspire, educate and prepare people of all ages to succeed 
                in the workforce of today and tomorrow.

                We partner with our grantees to rethink the pathways into and through the tech sector, grow
                more diverse talent pipelines and fundamentally reimagine the education and workforce systems 
                in which we operate—and while our work is far from over, we are proud of the positive impact our 
                investments have made since the foundation was established in 2018. </p><br>
                
                <p><p>
                    We're leveraging the power of digital technology to amplify our impact and
                    do more good in the world. Building on our longstanding investments in corporate social 
                    responsibility, we've committed to a five-year, $250 million effort to advance economic 
                    mobility, educational opportunity, health and well-being in communities around the globe.

                    We've also launched new diversity and inclusion programs in partnership with our employee 
                    affinities—supporting African American, Latinx, LGBTQ, Pan-Asian, women and veteran communities—to 
                    create true social change. <br><br>
